# Project Overview

Welcome to my project! This is a simple web page featuring a list of tasks implemented with various functionalities. The project includes an image slider, a simple calculator, and a card management system. Additionally, the main page is designed using HTML and CSS to provide a cohesive user interface. Below is a brief overview of each task and how to use the card management system.

## Main Page
- **Description:** The main page serves as the landing page for the project. It is built using HTML and CSS to provide a clean and structured layout. The page acts as a container for the various tasks implemented in the project.

## Tasks Overview

### 1. Image Slider
- **Description:** The image slider is a dynamic component that allows users to view a series of images in a slideshow format. Users can navigate through the images using previous and next buttons, or automatic transitions. This feature is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to enhance user experience with interactive image presentations.

### 2. Simple Calculator
- **Description:** The simple calculator is a basic arithmetic tool that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users can input numbers and select operations to perform calculations. The calculator interface is designed to be user-friendly, with clear buttons and a display area showing the results of calculations. It uses JavaScript for functionality and event handling.

### 3. Card Management System
- **Description:** The card management system allows users to manage cards associated with different users. It includes features to add, edit, delete, and view cards. This system is built using AJAX for asynchronous data fetching and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) principles for structured code management.

- **API Usage:** The card management system interacts with an API for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on cards. You can access the full API documentation and source code [here](https://github.com/lh-rubz/Netlify-express).
